<h3>Photography Policy</h3>

<h4>Portrait Photography</h4>

<p>Photographers and videographers who conduct portrait photography at Red Butte Garden are required to purchase a Portrait Photography Permit which is available at either a daily or yearly rate.</p>

<p><b>Definition of Portrait Photography:</b> Red Butte Garden defines portrait photography as wedding, engagement, family portraits, or other posed portraiture of individuals by professional photographers/videographers or by amateurs acting in the role of a professional.</p>

<p><b>Daily Permits:</b> A Portrait Photography Permit for non-exclusive use of the Garden may be purchased for $100 per day and covers the admission fee for the photographer and one assistant. All participants will be charged the regular admission fee.</p>

<p><b>Yearly Permits:</b> Photographers/Videographers may purchase a yearly Portrait Photography Permit for $500. Photography studios with more than one photographer will be charged an extra $25 per additional photographer and each photographer will be provided with their own permit. The permit will be valid for the photographer listed on the card and one assistant. All participants will be charged the regular admission fee. The permit is valid for a year from the date of purchase. All other rules and regulations apply.</p>

<p><b>Wedding Photography/Portraits:</b> All wedding portraits must call ahead to schedule their session. We hold many wedding ceremonies and receptions at the Garden and will refuse requests for wedding photography during another's wedding. Any unscheduled wedding photography will be turned away if a wedding has also been scheduled for that day. Reservations are accepted up to 30 days in advance of the shoot.
