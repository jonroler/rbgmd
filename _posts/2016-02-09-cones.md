<div class="text-center">Winter sets the stage for the conifers and their unique reproductive structures called cones. Conifers are classified as gymnosperms. The term gymnosperm translates to mean 'naked seed' because their seeds do not develop within an ovary. Instead, they are protected by a cone, and what attractive cones they are! </div>

  <p>Gray Alder &nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Alnus incana</i></p>
  <p>I know, I know, the alder is not a conifer but just look at these beautiful catkins. On the left are the male catkins and on the right are the female catkins that eventually develop to look cone-like as pictured above.</p>
