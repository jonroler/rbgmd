		<p>Your book preference will depend on how you like information organized and on your level of experience. Here are some titles from my book shelves starting with plant identification references and moving on to gardening with natives references.</p>
		
		<p>One of the best ways to get to know native flora is using plant checklists for specific areas you are interested in. Checklists are usually available at visitor centers or can be found on-line, printed, and brought with you on your excursion.</p>
